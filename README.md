# IEEE-754 Floating Point Converter

The "IEEE-754 Floating Point Converter" is a Python application that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for converting decimal numbers to their IEEE-754 binary representation and vice versa. It also includes functionality to convert binary IEEE-754 representations back to decimal numbers. The GUI is built using the tkinter library and allows users to interact with the application easily.

## Features

- Convert decimal numbers to IEEE-754 binary representation.
- Convert binary IEEE-754 representations to decimal numbers.
- GUI interface for user-friendly interaction.
- History log to keep track of the latest conversions.

## Requirements

To run the "IEEE-754 Floating Point Converter" application, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- tkinter library (typically included with Python).
- PIL (Python Imaging Library) library.

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install Pillow
```

## Usage

1. Download the "IEEE-754 Floating Point Converter.py" file to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is located.

3. Run the application by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   python "IEEE-754 Floating Point Converter.py"
   ```

4. The GUI window will open, providing options to convert decimal numbers to IEEE-754 binary representation and vice versa.

5. To convert a decimal number to binary, enter the decimal value in the provided entry field and click the "Decimal to IEEE-754" button. The result will be displayed in the text box below.

6. To convert a binary IEEE-754 representation to a decimal number, enter the binary value in the provided entry field and click the "IEEE-754 to Decimal" button. The result will be displayed in the text box below.

7. The "Latest operations" section displays a history log of the five most recent conversions performed.

8. To clear the input fields and results, click the "Clear" button.
